=head1 TITLE

pqldump - Dump a quotelike thing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 pqldump '"foo$bar"'
 pqldump fubar.pl
 pqldump -help
 pqldump -version

=head1 OPTIONS


=head2 -encoding

 -encoding utf-8

This option specifies the encoding of the entities to be parsed, and of
the output. If unspecified, no encoding is assumed unless the input is a
file, in which case the file's encoding is derived from its PPI parse.

=head2 -help

This option displays the documentation for this script. The script then
exits.

=head2 -indent

 -indent 4

This option controls the number of spaces each level of structure is
indented.

The default is C<-indent 2>.

=head2 -locations

If this Boolean option is true the locations of the tokens will be
dumped.

=head2 -margin

 -margin 2

This option controls the number of spaces of left margin.

The default is C<-margin 0>.

=head2 -perl-version

If asserted, this option causes the minimum Perl version (and the
maximum if applicable) to be dumped.

The defualt is C<-noperl-version>.

=head2 -ppi

If asserted, this option causes a PPI dump on any interpolations found.
L<PPI|PPI> must be installed for this to work.

The default is C<-noppi>.

=head2 -short

If this option is asserted, leading C<'PPIx::QuoteLike::'> will be
removed from the class names in the output.

The default is C<-noshort>.

=head2 -significant

If this option is asserted, only significant tokens are dumped. As of
version 0.004, this only has effect in combination with C<-tokens>,
since all tokens interior to the string are significant.

The default is C<-nosignificant>.

=head2 -tokens

If asserted, an unstructured dump of the tokens found is done.

The default is C<-notokens>.

=head2 -variables

If asserted, this option causes the names of variables interpolated by
any interpolations found to be dumped. L<PPI|PPI> must be installed for
this to work.

The default is C<-novariables>.

=head2 -version

This option displays the version of this script. The script then exits.

=head2 -whitespace

This option is the inverse of L<-significant|/-significant>, and is
added for quasi-compatibility with the L<Perl::Critic|Perl::Critic>
C<ppidump> tool.

The default is (and must be) C<-whitespace>.

=head1 DETAILS

This Perl script is a command-line interface to
L<PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper|PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper>'s
L<dump()|PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper/dump> method. The arguments can be
either literals or files. For files, all literals in the file are
dumped.
