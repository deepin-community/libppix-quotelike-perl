=head1 NAME

PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation - Represent an interpolation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class should not be instantiated by the user. See below for public
methods.

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation> is a
L<PPIx::QuoteLike::Token|PPIx::QuoteLike::Token>.

C<PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl class represents an interpolation into a quote-like string.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports the following public methods in addition to those of
its superclass:

=head2 ppi

 my $ppi = $elem->ppi();

This convenience method returns the L<PPI::Document|PPI::Document>
representing the content. This document should be considered read only.
An exception will be thrown if L<PPI::Document|PPI::Document> can not be
loaded.

Note that the content of the returned L<PPI::Document|PPI::Document> may
not be the same as the content of the original
C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Interpolation>. This can happen because
interpolated variable names may be enclosed in curly brackets, but this
does not happen in normal code. For example, in C</${foo}bar/>, the
content of the C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Interpolation> object will be
C<'${foo}'>, but the content of the C<PPI::Document> will be C<'$foo'>.

=head2 variables

 say "Interpolates $_" for $elem->variables();

This convenience method returns all interpolated variables. Each is
returned only once, and they are returned in no particular order.

B<NOTE> that this method is discouraged, and may well be deprecated and
removed. My problem with it is that it returns variable names rather
than L<PPI::Element|PPI::Element> objects, leaving you no idea how the
variables are used. It was originally written for the benefit of
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter|Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter>,
but has proven inadequate to that policy's needs.
